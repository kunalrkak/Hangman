Hangman:
=============================================================
~ BerkeleyX - CS169.1x ~

Used the Sinatra framework to make the Hangman game available
as SaaS.  Adapted the game logic for SaaS by thinking about RESTful routes and service-oriented architecture.
Also used Cucumber to describe how gameplay will work from the player's point of view and as
"full stack" integration tests that will drive SaaS development.
